#+TITLE: TUI Report

* Introduction
  
  In order to decide which framework we would use to build our TUI (Text User
  Interface) we searched for Python and C/C++ frameworks.

  After looking at various frameworks, we chose the Asciimatics (a python
  framework) because it was easy to manipulate (create windows and commands).

* Asciimatics Informations

  Asciimatics is a package to help people create full-screen text UIs (from
  interactive forms to ASCII animations) on any platform. It is licensed under
  the Apache Software Foundation License 2.0.

  Currently the API has been proven to work on CentOS 6 & 7, Raspbian (i.e.
  Debian wheezy), Ubuntu 14.04, Windows 7, 8 & 10 and OSX 10.11, so it should
  also work for our purposes.
