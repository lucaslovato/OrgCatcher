#+TITLE: Sensors of the small concrete block

* Introduction
   We have built a small concrete block(check Figure 1, to see our first
   concrete block sample), to check our sensor's behavior, in order to adapt and
   prepare them for the official Drawbridge safe. This report intends to update
   the reader on the tests we're currently doing with the sensors(microphone,
   accelerometer, gyroscope and temperature) embedded in concrete.

   reports on the development of Drawbridge for context.

* Sensors

** Accelerometer
    The accelerometer is fully functional, capturing changes when the concrete
    block is hit, rotated or moved. The image below shows a print of measures
    taken from the GY-521 ( accelerometer).

** Microphone
    The microphone can barely capture vibrations, only registering really hard
    hits to the concrete, over multiple frequencies. It didn't detect nothing
    when was tried to pierce the concrete with a small drill, which is worrying
    since this was expected to be easily noticeable. In order to solve that on
    the next sensor testing we will try to wrap the microphone inside some
    material capable of amplifying the vibrations on the concrete. Another
    possible solution is acquiring some metal proximity sensors, PNP NO 3-WIRE
    is an example, this way we could know if a drill is approaching the
    concrete.

** Temperature
    The temperature sensor will need to be tested again on our next
    concrete test, since the one we tested on this batch was not working,
    probably one of the wires inside broke off.

* Conclusion

   It was a interesting test, since those sensor's good behavior is fundamental
   for achieving our goal of having a secure safe. Only one of the three sensors
   could be validated on this test, which is the accelerometer, the remaining
   sensors will need new tests with different approaches to embedding them on
   concrete.
